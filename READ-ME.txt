The game was acctualy created following a tutorial from the Udemy course:
Complete C# Unity Developer 2D :https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/learn/v4/content
,section 5:Block Breaker;which is a single player game.
The github project that the teacher provides us in the end of the tutorial is:
https://github.com/CompleteUnityDeveloper/05-Block-Breaker.

However, during the tutorial,we changed the Gameplay, Game Physics, Input Management System, parts of the scripts and some Assets.
All the changes were made in order to create a local multiplayer game, that has only one in game scene.
So, this proves it was an active learning process in the first place and we also brought our own effort to meet the requirements.
